    title: "Value Added Tax (VAT) Adjustments",
    summary: "The standard VAT rate will see a minor increase, with new exemptions for essential goods and services to cushion the impact on low-income households.",
    details: "The 2025 tax reform introduces a modest increase in the standard VAT rate from 7.5% to 8.0%. However, to protect vulnerable populations, the list of exempt items has been expanded to include basic food staples, educational materials, and renewable energy equipment. This change aims to broaden the tax base from consumption while ensuring that essential needs remain affordable. Businesses will need to update their invoicing systems to reflect the new rate and correctly apply exemptions."

    title: "Personal Income Tax (PIT) Bands",
    summary: "PIT bands are being restructured to be more progressive, offering tax relief to low and middle-income earners while increasing the rate for top earners.",
    details: "A key feature of the reform is the restructuring of Personal Income Tax bands. The tax-free threshold has been raised to ₦40,000 monthly. The new structure introduces more income brackets, ensuring a smoother and more progressive tax curve. Those earning below ₦1 million annually will see a reduction in their effective tax rate, while a new higher bracket has been introduced for individuals earning above ₦20 million per year. This aims to reduce income inequality and increase the tax contribution from high-net-worth individuals."

    title: "Corporate Income Tax (CIT) for SMEs",
    summary: "Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with a turnover below ₦50 million will benefit from a reduced Corporate Income Tax rate.",
    details: "To stimulate economic growth and support small businesses, the reform lowers the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) for SMEs. Companies with an annual turnover of less than ₦50 million will now be taxed at a rate of 15%, down from the previous 20%. For companies with turnover between ₦50 million and ₦100 million, the rate remains at 20%. This incentive is designed to encourage formalization, investment, and job creation within the SME sector, which is a critical driver of the Nigerian economy."

    title: "Digital Services Tax",
    summary: "A new tax will be applied to digital services provided by non-resident companies, ensuring a level playing field for local businesses.",
    details: "The reform introduces a Digital Services Tax (DST) aimed at large, non-resident technology companies that generate significant revenue from Nigerian users. This tax will be levied at a flat rate of 6% on revenues derived from Nigeria. It covers services such as online advertising, streaming, and e-commerce platforms. The DST aims to ensure that foreign digital firms contribute fairly to the Nigerian treasury, just as local businesses do, thereby promoting tax equity in the rapidly growing digital economy."
